# Life Values

> What are the values important in your life?

### Values

Values are what you consider important to the life you want to live. They are
based upon your **core beliefs** - things that matter to you and are important
truths in how you want to live your life.

### Core beliefs

Core beliefs are basic beliefs about ourselves, other people, and the world we

Hello Cathie, I am Trevor.

The first three prioritiesed values for me are Kindness, Growth and Forgiveness.

We are what we think, and what we do. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern also urged
for everyone to "be kind" to one another during the lockdown, we are in a
community, how we treat each other will eventually apply to ourselves. So, why
not become a better person and let our community become better?

The reason I value the Growth is because we live in a fast-pace world, new
knowledges come out everyday, and are delivered to everyone with a faster
speed, so we have far more oppotunities than before, keeping learning and
up-skilling is the demand of our life and work.

We are surely encountering problems and troubles in this world, maybe that is
the real life. Rather than being angry and depressed, just let it be water
under the bridge, forgive others or the environment, relief ourselves and have
a good day!

I haven't totally achieved those values yet, but that's extractly the reason
why I value them so much.
