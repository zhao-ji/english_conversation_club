## Friendships

> Statistically, the number of friends we have, reduce as we age. We usually have lots of friends as children, many as teenagers, several close friends in our 20s and 30s and often fewer friends when our jobs or careers require more commitment, as we enter relationships, marry or have children. More than often, the older we get, the fewer friends we have.
